# Experiments in autonomic systems for resource management in embedded mobile robots

Source code for the experiments performed for the "Autonomic Computing Towards Resource Management in Embedded Mobile Robots" paper, submitted to [ICINCO 2018](http://www.icinco.org/).

The experiments validate the proposed system, in which different computational parameters (e.g. CPU load) are controlled via application or hardware settings (e.g. update rate, camera resolution).

The code present here must be run on a Raspberry Pi computer with a camera module.
